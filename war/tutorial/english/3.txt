Applications are structured through packages and subpackages.
This implies that every class has a certain <b>path</b> within the application.
<br>
<br>
To find the path in the visualization, you have to follow the <b>layers</b> to the desired class.
The path of a class, which is contained in the main package, is <i>(Neo4j).org.neo4j.kernel.main</i>.
