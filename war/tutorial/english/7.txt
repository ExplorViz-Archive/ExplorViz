As you can see, all communications that don't enter the package turn transparent, and only those beloning to the package stay orange. <br>
You will also notice red or blue arrow heads on the communications to mark the direction. <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">Red</span> stands for incoming, <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">blue</span> for outgoing.<br>
