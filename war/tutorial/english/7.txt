Now all communications that don't start or end at the Main class have turned transparent. <br>
The <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">red</span> or <span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold">blue</span> arrow heads on the communications denote the direction. Red stands for incoming communication and blue stands for outgoing communication.<br>
Note: If communication in both directions takes place, both arrow heads are displayed.<br>

You can also click on packages to highlight their aggregated communication.
