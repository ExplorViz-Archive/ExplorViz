This is the application visualisation. <br>
Here you can see the internal communication of an application. The <span style="color:#15992a; font-weight:bold">dark green</span> blocks represent <b>components</b>, <span style="color:#6848b4; font-weight:bold">purple</span> ones represent <b>classes</b>.<br>
The <span style="color:#ff981d; font-weight:bold">orange</span> lines represent the communication between the classes and components. The thicker the lines, the more communication happes.<br>

Communication with other applications is shown as incoming and outgoing communication that ends in black figures to represent the other application.
