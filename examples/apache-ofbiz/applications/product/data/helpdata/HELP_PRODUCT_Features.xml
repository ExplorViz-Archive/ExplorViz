    <title>Catalog Features overview </title>
    <anchor xml:id="ProductCatalogFeatures"/>
    <para>To Sell and to Differentiate Products
Features are characteristics used to sell and to differentiate products. The Open for Business catalog manager allows you to define any feature set you wish for your products. Typical features include size and color. In Open for Business, features are associated, or applied, to products as Standard Features, Selectable Features, or Distinguishing Features.
</para>


    <section>
        <title> Standard features</title>
        <anchor xml:id="Standardfeatures"/>
        <para>Standard features are features which are associated with every instance of a product. An example might be the brand name of a product -- all instances of the product share the same brand name.
</para>

    </section>
    <section>
        <title> Selectable features</title>
        <anchor xml:id="Selectablefeatures"/>
        <para>Selectable features are features which the customer selects one from many available choices. For example, a shirt may be available in White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Pink. These colors would be selectable features of the variant product shirt, and the customer would be prompted to choose a color.
</para>
        <para>Each color, though, would be a standard feature of the physical product. Thus, White would be a selectable feature of the virtual product 'shirt' but a standard feature of 'white shirt.'
</para>

    </section>
    <section>
        <title> Distinguishing features</title>
        <anchor xml:id="Distinguishingfeatures"/>
        <para>Distinguishing features are features which distinguish one product from another and are used to show the customer which item she chose.
</para>

    <section>
        <title> Create and Maintain Product Features</title>
        <anchor xml:id="CreateMaintainProductFeatures"/>
        <para>These screens are for creating and maintaining product features, which are features or characteristics that are available for products. Here you will define what features can be available for products. Later, when working with the products, you will have a chance to define what features a particular product may have.
</para>

    <section>
        <title> Feature Categories and Feature Groups</title>
        <anchor xml:id="FeatureCategoriesandFeatureGroups"/>
        <para>Notice the sub-tabs for Feature Categories and Feature Groups. These are both used to help you organize your product features. Each feature can only belong to one category but as many groups as you need. For example, you can have a colors category that has colors White, Blue, Grey, Green, Yellow, Pink, Red, and Orange and a sizes category that has sizes XXS, XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL. Then, you can have one group for shirts that would have colors White, Blue, Grey and sizes S, M, L, XL, XXL, and another group for dresses that have colors Yellow, Pink, Red, Orange and sizes XXS, XS, S, M, and L.

 </para>

    <section>
        <title> Add Features to a Category</title>
        <para>Once you have created a feature category, you can click on it to add features to it. There is a link [Create new feature] which takes you to a screen to create a new product feature. Below this link is a list of product features already in this category. Important fields for product features are listed below.

 </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title> Feature Categories</title>
        <para>Click on [Feature Categories] (this is the default screen when you clicked on 'Features' above), and you will see a menu for editing a particular feature, if you remember its feature ID. (If not, you can edit it from the feature categories below.) Next, you will see a list of feature categories and their parent categories. The categories' ID codes are highlighted, and you can click on one to go to the feature category. At the very bottom is a menu for creating a new feature category. Here, you would enter the new feature category's name and specify a parent category for it (if it has one.) The category ID is automatically created for you.

 </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title> Working with Feature Groups</title>
        <para>Click on [Feature Groups] and you will see a screen showing a list of available feature groups, and an option to create a new feature group at the bottom. Click on the ID of the feature group, and you will be taken to a screen which shows all the features in this group (if there are any) and a menu to add more features to this group. Like feature categories, the IDs of feature groups are automatically created.

 </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>. Implement Feature-based Product Search</title>
        <para>You can associate feature categories or feature groups to a Product Category. Buy doing this will provide web store customer feature based product search ability. If customers choose to search within a given category and that category has features associated with it then they will be displayed as selectable filtering options (based on the associated product features) on the search form.</para>
