    <section>
        <title> Similar to Price Rules</title>
        <para>Promotions are similar to Price Rules (see Price Rules, below) but are used to record special promotional offers which apply to the entire order, rather than prices for a particular product. For example, the promotional manager can be used to set up rules to give customers a percentage discount if they purchase a minimum quantity, or to create a coupon code.

    <note>
        <title> Tied to Specific Stores</title>
        <para>Promotions are tied to specific stores, whereas price rules are applicable to all products (although you can specify the website, product catalog, or category for which a price rule is applicable).
</para>

    <section>
        <title> Opening Screen</title>
        <para>The opening screen lists all promotions which are currently available and a link for creating additional promotions; click on one to go to a promotion. You will also see a series of four tabs: [Promo], [Rules], [Stores] and [Codes].
</para>

    <section>
        <title> Promo tab</title>
        <para>At the top is general information about this promotion. Each promotion has an ID, a name and a longer descriptive text, which are shown to customers. If no text is entered, Open for Business will automatically generate text for you.
</para>
    </section>
    <note>
        <title> Rules discussion</title>
        <para>Rules for promotions are used to determine what actions should be taken in the promotion. Each promotion can have multiple rules, and each rule can have multiple conditions and actions. If a promotion had multiple rules, they would all be checked in sequence, and the rules whose conditions were true will be activated. This is especially helpful for complicated promotions that have multiple offers.
</para>

        <title>Stores tab</title>
