These configuration templates are for Weblogic 8.1 SP2, which was the latest version at the time of writing.

For ease of use these three files are meant to be used in the "examples" domain that comes with Weblogic.

The main reason for this is that it is difficult to configure Weblogic security settings for a new domain and this way it is easy to get started fast.

To use just put OFBiz somewhere on your system and once it is in place generate the Weblogic configuration files from the templates, as described in the ofbiz/framework/appservers/README file. Copy those files into the $WL_HOME/samples/domains/examples directory.

Before running there are some things that come by default in OFBiz that conflict with Weblogic. These are things to do before running:

1. Remove the jndi.properties file from ofbiz/base/config so that the Weblogic defaults will be used
2. Comment out or re-configure the RMIDispatcher container in the limited-containers.xml file in ofbiz/base/config

Now, just run the startOFBizServer.cmd or startOFBizServer.sh scripts that were generated above and copied into the examples domain directory.

Enjoy!
