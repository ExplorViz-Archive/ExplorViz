This directory contains templates for Glassfish Server v2.1 deployment
======================================================================

README                  - this file.
run.sh                  - loads seed and demo data into JavaDB that comes with
                          Glassfish server and then deploys OFBiz.
deploy.sh               - automatic deployment script. Builds WARs and the
                          ofbiz.ear and deploys onto glassfish.
domain.xml_patch        - updated to record the ofbiz home.
entityengine.xml_patch  - updated to use bundled JavaDB datasources.
url.properties          - updated to set the HTTPS port to 8181 (default port).
application.xml         - EAR metadata.



HOW-TO (this needs to be posted on the OFBiz documentation site)
======

1. Setup
    a. Create a folder somewhere on the disk with ~800MB free memory. 
       This becomes the work area. Referred as <work-folder> hence forth.
    b. Download Glassfish Server v2.1 and install. (Download it from [1])
    c. Download OFBiz source (if you have not done already). (Either 
       download the build from http://build.ofbiz.org or checkout from SVN. 
       Refer [2])
    d. Build OFBiz sources (in case of svn checkout) using 'ant' command. 
       This will create 'ofbiz.jar' file.
    e. Generate container templates for Glassfish v2.1 server.
         i. Goto the OFBiz source folder (referred as OFBIZ_HOME).
        ii. Use the command 'java -jar ofbiz.jar -setup glassfish21' to 
            generate the templates. For more information refer [3]. 
            This will create a new folder called 'setup' inside OFBIZ_HOME 
            and copy the generated templates under the folder 
            'setup/glassfish21'.


if (you are using JavaDB && want seed and demo data loaded) {
    Copy OFBIZ_HOME/setup/glassfish21/run.sh to <work-folder>;
    run run.sh script now!; 
    // (without quotes) './run.sh <glassfish_home> <glassfish-domain-path>'
} else {
 read ahead;
}


2. Install and start the database server if its not done already.
3. Create / update entityengine.xml to include your database server details. 
   Refer [4]. If you want to use JavaDB with default settings, you can use entityengine.xml_patch
   readily available under 'OFBIZ_HOME/setup/glassfish21'.
4. Load seed and demo data (optional, but highly recommended) by using
   './ant run-install' command under OFBIZ_HOME. Refer [5].
5. Copy OFBIZ_HOME/setup/glassfish21/deploy.sh to <work-folder>.
6. Run deploy.sh.
   (without quotes) './deploy.sh <glassfish-home> <glassfish-domain-path>'.
7. Check domain.xml for XML validation errors. This is to make sure the patching of domain.xml in previous step was done neatly.
8. Start/restart glassfish server if its not already running.
9. If you have opted for loading demo data, goto
   http://localhost:8080/ecommerce and http://localhost:8080/webtools to 
   verify the installation.
