######## Default WASCE/Geronimo Settings. Refer to the Guidelines in the OFBiz documentation : http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/IYBr ########
### Path to geronimo home (in other words, application server location).
# You may also use a GERONIMO_HOME env var, in such case let commented out here
### Linux
#geronimoHome=/home/jacques/IBM/WebSphere/AppServerCommunityEdition
#geronimoHome=/home/jacques/Apache Software Foundation/geronimo-tomcat6-jee5-2.0.3
### Windows
#*** Note that under Windows you must use / here in place of \ (or put \\)
#*** Beware for geronimo-2.0.3 snapshot, under Windows some files have a path longer than 256 chars. Hence I put it directly under c:
#*** Beware also if you use RMI you can't have spaces in path
#geronimoHome=C:/wasce
#geronimoHome=C:/geronimo-tomcat6-jee5-2.0.3

### user login
user=system
# password
password=manager

### Server is offline or not. Should be offline the 1st time you deploy since you need to copy after lines from META-INF/REAME hence by default true
offline=false

### Pause in deployment script ?
pauseInGeronimoScript=false

### Undeploy/Deploy (useful when offline) or Redeploy (implies that the server is running)
redeploy=false

### The number (instancesNumber) given here is in origin 0. Hence 0 means one instance.
# In other word you give the n-1 number of instances (n being the number of instances).
# For instance 2 means 3 instances deployed. # This to allow the default instance which is not numbered
instancesNumber=0

### host
#host=192.168.2.7
#geronimoHostHome=C/Program Files/IBM/WebSphere/AppServerCommunityEdition

### port
#port=31099
