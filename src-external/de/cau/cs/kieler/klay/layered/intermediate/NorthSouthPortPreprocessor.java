/**
 * Inserts dummy nodes to cope with northern and southern ports.
 * 
 * <p>For each node with northern or southern ports, dummy nodes are inserted in the node's
 * layer above or below the node. (for northern and southern ports, respectively) Assume
 * that a node has several northern ports. First, the ports are assembled in left-to-right
 * order according to their position. Then, the ports are partitioned into ports with
 * only incoming edges (in ports), ports with only outgoing edges (out ports) and ports
 * with both, incoming and outgoing edges (in/out ports). The way the dummy nodes are then
 * created can either be according to the <em>old approach</em> or the <em>new approach</em>.</p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>The Old Approach</h3>
 * 
 * <p>In and out ports are matched up left to right and right to left, respectively, as
 * long as the out port is right of the in port. In the example below, ports P1 and P6
 * will be matched, as will be ports P2 and P5. Ports P3 and P4 will not be matched since
 * P3 is an out port and not right of P4.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For each pair of matched ports, a dummy node is then inserted that is shared by both
 * ports. This leads to edges of both ports sharing the same y coordinate, which is fine
 * as long as the out port is right of the in port. When this is no longer the case,
 * ports cannot share a dummy node anymore. (the horizontal edge segments would overlap
 * and thus introduce ambiguity) Thus, P4 and P3 each get their own dummy node.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Once in and out ports are processed, in/out ports are given their own dummy node.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This approach minimizes the amount of edge crossings among the edges connected to
 * northern ports locally, without paying attention to the rest of the graph. To do that,
 * this approach fixes the order of the dummy nodes in the layer: the node successor
 * constraints are set in a way that each dummy node points to the next, with the bottom-most
 * northern dummy node pointing to the regular node it was created for.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *                      ------------------------------
 *                      |
 * ---------------------+----
 *                      |   |
 * ------------------   |   |   ----------------------
 *                  |   |   |   |
 * --------------   |   |   |   |   ------------------
 *              |   |   |   |   |   |
 *              P1  P2  P3  P4  P5  P6
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>The New Approach</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The new approach is designed to not fix the order of dummy nodes at this point and
 * to instead leave the task of ordering them to the crossing minimization phase. It creates
 * a single dummy node for every northern port, without two ports sharing a dummy node.
 * The only necessary constraints are that dummy nodes created for northern ports must have
 * their regular node as their successor. (Similarly, the regular node must have all dummy
 * nodes created for southern ports as successors.)
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Self-Loops</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Self-loops are a special case that is handled party by this processor. For this to
 * work, the {@link SelfLoopProcessor} must have been executed prior to this processor's
 * execution. Then, this processor correctly processes all kinds of self-loops involving
 * northern or southern ports as follows: (due to the {@link SelfLoopProcessor}, only the
 * cases detailled below must be handled)</p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>West-north, west-south, north-east and south-east self-loops are handled just
 *     like every other connection.</li>
 *   <li>North-north and south-south self-loops are handled by creating a dummy node just
 *     for that self-loop.</li>
 *   <li>North-south self-loops are handled by adding a northern and a southern dummy,
 *     both having just one port via which they are connected. At the moment, the port
 *     is created on the eastern side of the dummy node, but that could be handled more
 *     clerverly later.</li>
 * </ul>
