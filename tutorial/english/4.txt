Some nodes are part of a node group (dark green). <br>
If a node group consists of several nodes that are exactly the same, 
the visualisation only shows one node to save space.<br>
Those node groups are marked with a + in the upper right corner.
By double clicking, the node group can be opened to show all nodes inside.<br>
<br>
Please open the node group 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.2 to continue to the next step.
